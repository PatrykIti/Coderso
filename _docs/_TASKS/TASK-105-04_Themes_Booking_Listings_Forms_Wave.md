## Overview

Attack the biggest medium-coverage product surfaces with real user-path tests.

## Priority Clusters

- `core/admin/ui/themes/*`
- `core/admin/ui/booking/*`
- `core/admin/ui/listings/*`
- `core/admin/ui/forms/*`

## Coverage Strategy

- theme route editor flows
- booking tabs and helpers
- listing editor/manager edge states
- form builder panels and drawers

## Pseudocode

```ts
renderPageWithMinimalCache();
renderPageWithCachedData();
renderErrorOrEmptyState();
assertProductSpecificControls();
```

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Each cluster gets meaningful state coverage, not just shell rendering.
2. Coverage increases across the largest medium-coverage admin modules.

## Testing Requirements

- `bun run test:vitest`
- `bun run test:coverage`
